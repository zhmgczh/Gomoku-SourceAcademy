# Gomoku-SourceAcademy
The project is about an ancient Asian game named Gomoku ( or “五子棋” in Chinese ). The game is based on the following simple rules: two players of whom one takes the black chessmen and the other takes the white chessmen take turns to put chessmen on the 15*15 chessboard, only adding one chessman at a turn. The one who first achieves such a situation where there are five chessmen with the same color in the same row, the same line or the same diagonal will win.
